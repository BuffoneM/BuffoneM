# Hello World! 😁

I'm Michael Buffone and I'm a 2021 undergraduate from Algoma University. I studied Computer Science for four years and am preparing to enter the workforce, as well as starting to work on some personal projects!

I flourish in team environments, and greatly enjoy working alongside others!

# About Me! ☕

I find myself spending a lot of time either tinkering on new computer builds, researching new technology, at the gym pursuing an active lifestyle, or out in the outdoors hiking. 

I have hobbies all over the place!

# Let's Work Together! 🦾
