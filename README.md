# Hello World! 😁

I'm Michael Buffone and I'm a 2021 undergraduate from Algoma University! I studied Computer Science for four years and starting to work on some personal projects!

# About Me! ☕

I find myself spending a lot of time either tinkering on new computer builds, at the gym pursuing an active lifestyle, or out in the outdoors hiking. 

I have hobbies all over the place!
